# Half-Life 2 Enhancement Mod
This is the README for Half-Life 2 Enhancement Mod, a mod for Source Engine.

Please use this repository to report bugs and feature requests for the mod.

# Conduct
There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with the mod. As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested. Patience is always appreciated.


# Reporting Issues
If you encounter a bug while using Source 1 games, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/AluminumKen/hl2em/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your [system information](#system-information).

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

# System information

Your system information must include:
- your or OS version
- your Graphics card info (manufacturer, card version), any and all graphics driver versions
- anything else that you think may be useful (mouse/keyboard, filesystem type, etc).

The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`).

Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`.
Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

Feature Requests
-------------------

If you are asking for a new feature or enhancement for a game, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/AluminumKen/hl2em/issues) to see if it has already been asked for. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has been asked for, go ahead and put your 2 cents in for it in the existing entry.

If it has not been asked for, create a new issue with at least the following information:

 - The game your asking for the enhancement
 - A clear description of what exactly you want
 - Justification as to why this is something that is needed
 - Why we should do this feature rather than doing some other feature on the list

Remember that just because you ask for a feature improvement doesn't mean we'll get to it. We're mostly going to be focused on existing bugs rather than enhancing these games. That being said, it does make a difference to know what you want here.  Be clear. Be concise.
